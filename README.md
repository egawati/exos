# EXOS : Explaining Outliers in Data Streams

Real-time outlier detection in data streams is a growing research area; however, little research has been done for generating explanations for outliers in this area. When outliers are detected, human experts are needed to examine them further. The investigation can be overwhelming in stream settings, primarily when users deal with the unbounded volume of multi-dimensional data. Presenting outliers along with their explanations can accelerate the investigation time. An outlier explanation can be outlying attributes which are a subset of features responsible for the outlier abnormality. Some techniques have been proposed to generate outlying attributes; however, none simultaneously addresses the unbounded volume, concept drift, and cross-correlation characteristics of data streams. To fill this gap, we propose EXOS, a framework to generate outlying attributes of each outlier detected in multiple source data streams. It applies a single-pass incremental eigendecomposition model to capture data attribute correlation within each source and across sources. The single-pass approach allows EXOS to handle the unbounded volume of data streams. To adapt to concept drift, the model is updated periodically.
